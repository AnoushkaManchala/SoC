# Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Elasticity

This repo contains my learning journey into **PINNs (Physics-Informed Neural Networks)**, 
including practice with PyTorch and a project on solving **2D elasticity equations** 
(plane stress condition on a loaded plate).

## Structure
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter notebooks for practice & step-by-step project build.
- `src/` → Clean Python implementations of models and PINNs.
- `results/` → Plots and outputs from experiments.

## Project
### 2D Elasticity (Main)
Implemented a PINN to solve the 2D elasticity equations, predicting displacement and stress fields 
in a square plate under plane stress conditions.

### Mini Projects
- PyTorch basics (tensors, autograd, NN training)
- PINN for 1D ODE / Heat equation
